Hereby, we propose a general concept for monitoring forest growth in nationally and worldwide using real-time data. The key to this concept is to simulate the mechanism of the stock indexing system. In this condition, it is not necessary to acquire each tree's data in real-time. The continuous observation instruments can only attach at “constituent trees” and then result in a forest stock index (FSI). Moreover, FSI has the potential to contribute to the real-time carbon sink in forests and any other related environmental indicators.

We evoke the cooperation of the worldwide forest continuous observation networks, starting from now (the end of the year 2022).
